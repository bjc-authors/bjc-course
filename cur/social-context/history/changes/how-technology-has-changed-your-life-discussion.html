            Technology has changed all of our lives, even in a short couple of decades.
            Other than how we look for apartments, how has technology impacted your way of life?
            Describe an activity that no one else has mentioned that has been changed by technology.
            Also briefly mention how it used to be done prior to the change in technology and how that
            method has changed due to technology.

            <b>For example:</b>
            How people look for an apartment has changed over the past 20 years.
            In the past, people might look in the newspaper classifieds or drive around town looking for signs.
            Today people check Craigslist or another website to quickly locate all of the apartments available in an area.
