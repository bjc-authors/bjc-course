        <h3>Python Modules</h3>
        <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
            So you've probably been wondering where the sprites and graphics are in python. It turns out that there are many different ways to display graphics in Python by using modules. A <b>module</b> is code that someone else has written that we can then <code>import</code> into our file and use.
        </p>
        <p>
            A simple and popular graphics module for Python is called <b>turtle</b>. To import the turtle module, add the following line of code to the top of your file:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import turtle
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            This imports the turtle module and allows us to use all of its functionality. If we want to call a function from the turtle module we would do something like below:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
turtle.forward(100) # moves the sprite 100 steps forward
        </code></pre>

        <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
            Sometimes we might want to rename the modules that we import so that they are more easy to type or have a more intuitive name.  Let's say that we felt like turtle was too long of a word to type before each function call. We could have instead written the following import line: <code>import turtle as t</code>. This would then allow us to access the turtle module via the alias name <code>t</code>. This would allow us to call a function like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import turtle as t
t.forward(100)
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Turtle Functions</h3>
        <p>
            The turtle module has all of the same drawing functions as Snap<em>!</em> and much more. A few of the module's functions are shown below, but if you want to learn more about the incredible things that you can do with turtle please refer to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">documentation</a>. The first time that you call any one of the turtle functions a new window will open for the turtle to draw in. You can think of this window as being analogous to the stage in Snap<em>!</em> its just that we only see the "stage" in python when we actually draw something.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
# moves the sprite 100 steps forward
turtle.forward(100)

# moves the sprite 100 steps backward
turtle.backward(100)

# rotate to the right 45 degrees
turtle.right(45)

# rotate to the left 45 degrees
turtle.left(45)

# Pen doesn't draw when moving
turtle.penup()

# Pen draws when moving
turtle.pendown()

# Go to a coordinate (x: 130, y: -50)
# The turtle starts at the center of the stage which is at position (x: 0, y: 0)
turtle.goto(130, -50)

# Write the string "Hello World!" to the stage at the sprite's current position.
# Don't worry too much about the font=(...) part, just make sure it's there.
# Refer to the official documentation for more information (linked above).
turtle.write("Hello World!", font=("Arial", 30, "normal"))

# clear all drawings on the stage
turtle.clear()
        </code></pre>

        <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
            As you can see almost all of these functions are identical to what is in Snap<em>!</em>. Many of these functions have abbreviations as well, such as <code>turtle.fd(100)</code> which moves the sprite forward. Check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">documentation</a> for other tips, tricks, and help.
        </p>

        <h3>Exercise 4</h3>
        <p>Write a program that uses turtle to draw something interesting. Try using loops or recursion for extra fun.
