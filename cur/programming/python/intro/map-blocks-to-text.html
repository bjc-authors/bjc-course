        <h2><b>Welcome to Besides Blocks (Part 1)!</b></h2>

              Snap<em>!</em> is a graphical programming language ("click and drag", "drop and plop", "snapping" blocks together). Most other programming languages are textual, which you must type out. In this lab, you will get to practice using the command line, which is simply the an interface where you type instructions for the computer to execute. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Syntax is how code is organized in a way for the machine to execute it predictably and properly. In Snap<em>!</em>, this is determined by things like the shapes of blocks (and the colors help format code consistently). Snap<em>!</em> has a friendly interface which does not let us make many syntax errors, like putting a round reporter block inside of a hexagonal predicate parameter space; Why? Because it wouldn't make sense, and would cause an error for the machine. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Python has syntax and rules for arranging code and how the text must fit together in a logical way. One objective of this lab is to practice basic Python syntax, not necessarily how to program, because you have been programming all semester! Another objective is to be aware of how to approach problems in a new way, while still implementing background knowledge of computer science concepts. 
          </p>
          <p>
              <h><b> Example </b></h>
              Let's take a look at this simple max function in Python<br><br>
              <table style="width:500px">
                  <tr>
                      <td><img src="../../../../img/python/max.png" alt="max function"/></td>
                      <td>
                          <pre><code class="python">
def max(x, y):
    if (x > y):
        return x
    else:
        return y
                        </code></pre>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
              </table>
          </p>
          <p>
              Look at how they are <b>very</b> similar! The code is practically identical, line by line, only with some special Python syntax. Even the structures of both functions are identical. Notice how the two Snap<em>!</em> "report" blocks are nested inside the if/else block, and how the "return" statements in Python are indented within the if/else statement. These functions accomplish and communicate the same thing, but are implemented in two different languages.
