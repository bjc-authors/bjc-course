        You may have noticed that you didn't make the entire Tic-Tac-Toe program; we only made a strategy that a computer would use when given the position. Therefore, when the computer gives back a move, the position is never updated. There is also no interaction between the user and the computer.
       </p><p>
        If you like (or if you have time), you can implement this interaction between the user and the computer, and include any fancy visuals in BYOB.
       </p>

        Also, the tic-tac-toe strategy that we implemented is not perfect either. Think about the last two strategy that were mentioned earlier:
     </p>   
        <ul>
            <li>
                If we can make a move that allows us to win on the next turn, we take that move.
            </li>

            <li>
                If there is a move that the opponent can make that will make them win in two moves, then block it
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Including these two would make the program play tic-tac-toe perfectly. 
        It is possible to implement these two strategies into the program, but it is difficult. 
        But if you think you are up for it, absolutely try it!.
