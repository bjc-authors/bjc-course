<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how BYOB can be used to wait for a certain time before reporting anything. &Acirc;&nbsp;BYOB also allows us to do the converse: to report how long a program takes to finish. &Acirc;&nbsp;In the <tt>Sensing</tt> menu, you will see a command called <tt>reset timer</tt> and a reporter called <tt>timer</tt>: <br><br></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activate (tick-mark) the <tt>timer</tt> reporter and you should see a timer ticking away above Alonzo. &Acirc;&nbsp;It's been ticking ever since you opened up BYOB, and counts in tenths of a second:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to be performing timing experiments in the following sections, so this timer will prove useful. &Acirc;&nbsp;Add the following timing framework script into the space for BYOB scripts:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The script will reset the timer whenever the green flag is pressed. Alonzo will then say <tt>Hello!</tt> for 1 second, and soon after that, he will say the current time, less 1 second to account for how long he said <tt>Hello!</tt>. &Acirc;&nbsp;If we replace <tt>Hello!</tt> with a reporter, then Alonzo will say the answer of the reporter, and one second later, how long the reporter took to generate the answer: this is the timing information that we need. &Acirc;&nbsp;Save the script with the name <tt>TimingFramework</tt>.   </body></html>
