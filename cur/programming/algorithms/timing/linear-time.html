<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have noticed that if you increased <code>max</code> by a factor of two, then the computer took approximately twice as much time to fill the <code>numbers</code> list.&nbsp; Similarly, if you increased <code>max</code> by a factor of ten, then the computer took approximately ten times as much time; if you increased <code>max</code>
by a factor of 100, then the computer ran approximately 100 times
longer.&nbsp; In general, as we scale the size of the input by a
certain amount, we also scale the running time by the same
amount.&nbsp; We call these algorithms <strong>linear-time</strong> algorithms, because if we were to plot the runtime of one such algorithm against the size of its input, we would get a line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the algorithm a linear-time algorithm?&nbsp; When <code>max</code> was set to <code>20</code>, we had to add 20 numbers to the <code>numbers</code> list; when <code>max</code> was set to <code>40</code>, we had to add 40 numbers to the number list.&nbsp; In other words, as we scaled <code>max</code>, we also scaled how many numbers we had to add to the <code>numbers</code>
list by the same amount.&nbsp; Linear-time algorithms are also much
sought-after in computer science, and for many problems, they are the
fastest algorithms you can find.</p>       </div>
