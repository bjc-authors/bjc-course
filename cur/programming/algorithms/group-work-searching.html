		We're going to step away from the computer for this activity. First things first: divide up into groups. Let&rsquo;s examine a common computer science problem: finding a number in a list of numbers. We can assume that the user will provide a specific number to look for, and we need to develop an algorithm that will find what location the number they're searching for is located in (or if it's absent). A computer can only check one position in a list at a time, and checking positions takes time. Let's say we're searching through a list where the numbers are random (within a range) and unique (the same number won't be in there twice). As you might imagine, there are several different ways that you can find a particular number in this type of list, but we know that many algorithms have advantages over others. We'll use a set of numbered cups in this activity to represent different pieces of data. Let&rsquo;s call the number of cups N.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>Our first goal is to find a specific number among a bunch of randomly chosen cups. Using your set of cups as a testbed, work with your group to <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">develop an algorithm <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">(remember: set of steps) to do this.</span></span></span></span> Your algorithm should work for any set of random numbers. <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">D<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">iscuss the following ideas with your group to help your thought process</span></span></span></span>:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				What strategies exist for finding a particular number in the fewest number of location checks?
			</li>
			<li>
				How many guesses would it take on average to find a number?
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didn&rsquo;t exist in the list at all?
			</li>
			<li>
				How much additional work will it be to find a number if N were to increase?
