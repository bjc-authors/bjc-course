			We would like to add all the numbers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>N</tt>. One way we can do this is to manually add them, one by one.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can, however, also follow in the footsteps of the young Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, a now-revered 18th century mathematician. 
			As the (possibly apocryphal) story goes, he was punished by his elementary school teacher to do the same exercise: 
			add all the numbers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>100</tt>. The teacher, J. G. B&Atilde;&frac14;ttner, assumed that the problem 
			would take Gauss a long time to do, yet Gauss finished the problem in a matter of seconds. He realized that, 
			adding <tt>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100</tt> was the same as adding <tt>(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + ... + (50 + 51)</tt>. 
			Each pair summed up to <tt>101</tt>, and there were <tt>50</tt> of these pairs, so he quickly deduced that the answer was <tt>101 x 50 = 5050</tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, if you wanted to add the numbers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>N</tt>, the answer would be <tt>(N + 1) * (N/2)</tt>, 
			because there are <tt>(N/2)</tt> pairs, each of which add up to <tt>(N + 1)</tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine that you were playing a game against young Gauss to see who could add numbers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>N</tt> faster: 
			he does it his way, while you manually add them one by one. You can either win, lose, or tie in this game. 
			What do you think would happen if <tt>N</tt> were <tt>2</tt>? If <tt>N</tt> were <tt>10</tt>? 
			If <tt>N</tt> were <tt>100</tt>? If <tt>N</tt> were a million?
