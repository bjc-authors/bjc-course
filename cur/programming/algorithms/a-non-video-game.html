	A (Non-Video) Game
</title><!--ORIGINAL NAME: A (Non-Video) Game--></head><body>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's play a number-guessing game (you have already seen the Scratch version <a href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/mod/resource/view.php?id=1725">in lab 3</a>). &Acirc;&nbsp;<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between your partner and yourself, decide who will be person G, the guesser: the other person (person P, for picker) picks a number between 1 and 50. &Acirc;&nbsp;Person G asks person P questions to determine the chosen number; the only answers that person P can give are "yes" or "no". &Acirc;&nbsp;The guesser should try two different strategies to playing this game: <br><ol><li>Guessing in sequence: "Is the number 1?", "Is the number 2?", "Is the number 3?", and so on.<br><br></li>
		<li>Guessing halfway: &Acirc;&nbsp;You know the number must be between 1 and 50, so you start off by asking "Is the number greater than 25?". &Acirc;&nbsp;If the answer is "yes", you instantly know that it must be between 26 and 100, so you ask "Is the number greater than 50?"; otherwise, the number must be between 1 and 25, so you ask "Is the number greater than 12?" &Acirc;&nbsp;Keep asking questions involving the halfway point.</li>
	</ol>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play several (around 3) games: person P should pick a wide variety of numbers, while person G should use each strategy alternately. &Acirc;&nbsp;As you play each game, think about which strategy involves fewer questions. &Acirc;&nbsp;Which strategy would be better if, say, the guessing game involved numbers from 1 to 1000? &Acirc;&nbsp;From 1 to a million? &Acirc;&nbsp;Discuss why one strategy better than the other?   </body></html>
