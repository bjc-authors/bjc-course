    <h3>Saving Your Queries</h3>
    <li><b>Important note when saving:</b> Do this every time you make a query. The web application can only save one query at a time. This is different from Snap! where multiple different connected blocks can exist at once in your workspace. This means after every exercise, you should save your query as either a view or a file if you want to keep a version of it. Otherwise, to remember what you did you can just take a screenshot. To screenshot on a Mac you can press <i>Command-Shift-4</i> and drag over the area you want to take an image of. On Windows, you can use the Snipping Tool. </li>
    <li><b>Save each query as a view (Optional).</b> Make sure the query result and node result is what you want. Saving a view will essentially make a block that shows the result of the query. However, it will not show what blocks you used to make it. Once you make a view, the block will automatically appear in your data sets palette.</li>

    <li><b>Save each query as a file .dbs file. (Required for checkoff)</b> This will automatically download the query in your Downloads folder (if not, it should say which folder it will be located in. See picture below). Make sure you do this step if you want to open the query later on in DBSnap because it doesn&#39t save to an account like Snap! does</li>

    <li><b>Clear the workspace after each query.</b> The application will not recognize a query result if there are multiple queries in the workspace. </li>

    <h3>How to import your query back into your workspace?</h3>
    <li>Simply press the <b><u>import query</u></b> button and choose the according .dbs file that was saved to your Downloads folder.</li>
