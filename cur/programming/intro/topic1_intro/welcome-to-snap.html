   			<strong>A. Welcome to <em>Snap!</em></strong>
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			So what exactly is <em>Snap!</em>?
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			<em>Snap!</em> is a programming language -- a notation in which you can tell the computer what you want it to do. However, unlike most programming languages, <em>Snap!</em> is a visual language. Instead of writing a program using the keyboard, you will use the drag-and-drop interface in <em>Snap!</em> to tell the computer what to do.

   		<p>
   			Let’s begin by opening <em>Snap!</em>. The url that you can use to always get to <em>Snap!</em> is: http://snap.berkeley.edu/run (opens in a new tab). Use Chrome to open <em>Snap!</em> as <em>Snap!</em> functions the best in Chrome.

   			Now let’s make a user account with the <em>Snap!</em> server. Find the cloud-shaped button in the top toolbar on the upper left corner of the window (see below image). Click it, select the "sign up" option in the menu, and follow the instructions there. You will need to check your email after creating your account to get your initial password.
