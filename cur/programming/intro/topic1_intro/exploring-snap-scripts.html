        <p>
        	Now that you have figured out how to make a sprite move, you might be wondering how to make the sprite do other things as well!
        </p>
        <p>
        	To make a sprite do more than just move, we need to use different types of blocks and link them together. You can link blocks by snapping (hence the name <em>Snap!</em>) them together -- drag a block right underneath the one to which you want to attach it. Blocks will snap together when the blockâ€™s indentation is near the tab of the one above it. You should see a white bar appear like the one in the image below, which just shows you where the block will go after you drop it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_blocks_snapping.png" alt="Blocks Snapping Together"/>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		If you keep attaching blocks together in this way, you will create something that we call a script. A <em>Snap!</em> program consists of one or more of these scripts. These scripts can be long or short depending on how much you want the sprite to do.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Try recreating this in the scripting area in <em>Snap!</em>. You will find the <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_sayhellofor2secs.png" alt="Say Hello for 2 Seconds Block"/> underneath the Looks tab.

    	</p>
    	<p>
    		What will happen if you run this script? Remember, a script will tell the sprite what to do. Click on the script and see what happens! You will know that your script is running if your script has a highlighted border around it after having clicked on it like in the image below.
