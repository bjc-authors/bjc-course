            Now that you have figured out how to make a sprite move, you might be wondering how to make the sprite do other things as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make a sprite do more than just move, we need to use different types of blocks and link them together. You can link blocks by snapping (hence the name Snap<em>!</em>) them together -- drag a block right underneath the one to which you want to attach it. Blocks will snap together when one block&#8217s indentation is near the tab of the one above it. You should see a white bar appear like the one in the image below, which just shows you where the block will go after you drop it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="indent" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_blocks_snapping.png" alt="Blocks Snapping Together"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you keep attaching blocks together in this way, you will
            create a <em>script</em>. A Snap<em>!</em>
            program consists of one or more of these scripts.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Try recreating the following script in the scripting
            area in Snap<em>!</em>.  The purple <code>say...</code> blocks
            are available from the <b>Looks</b> tab.
            <br>
            <br>

            <img class="center" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_justmadeascript.png" alt="You just made a script!"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            What will happen if you run this script? Remember, a
            script will tell the sprite what to do. Click on the script and see
            what happens! You will know that your script is running if it has a
            highlighted border around it:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="center" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_highlightedscript.png" alt="Script Running"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to note: <b>blocks in a script run in a specific order,
            from the top of the script to the bottom</b>.

            Generally, Snap<em>!</em>
            waits until
            one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it.
            (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be
            to <i>start</i> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while
            the sound is still playing.
