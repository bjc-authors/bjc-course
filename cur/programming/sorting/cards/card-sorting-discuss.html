		<p>
			Think about how fast you could do this <i>if you had the whole class to help</i>.
			What would your strategy be?
			As partners, write up with a detailed description of your strategy; you teacher will 
			have you share it with the rest of the class.
			Your fellow students should, after simply <u>reading</u> your description,
			be able to act it out! So make sure you provide enough clear detail.
		</p>
		<p>
			After your fellow student teams have written their strategies,
			you will choose two of them and make a prediction about how long it would take.
			(Remember how long it took you working alone...)
