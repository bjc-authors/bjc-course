<h2>Exercise</h2> With all that you have learned about lists in this lab and in the previous lab, you are ready to make a high-score list that stores the names and scores of players of a game. The list keeps track of the names of the players and the scores (in order) as shown below. The goal is to write a block that allows you to add a new player to your high-score list. You may find this block useful in later projects. <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img border="0" title="Example of a High-Score list" alt="Example of a High-Score list" src="/bjc-r/img/list/high-scores-list2-BYOB.gif" ></div> <br> To complete this task, you will make the following blocks that will help you build an abstraction layer. 
<ul><li> <code>Get name from/Get score from</code>: Instead of always manually accessing the score or the name from a list element, you can write blocks that take a list and an index as inputs and report either the name or score of a player.</li> 
  <li> <code>Add new score</code>: This block should add the name provided (<code>Colleen</code>) along with the new score (<code>52</code>) that is also provided as input. <em>The new score entry should appear in the correct order</em>.</li> 
</ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/High-Score-List-Blocks-BYOB.gif" alt="Blocks for the High Score List" title="Blocks for the High Score List" ></div> 
<h2>Test Cases</h2> As we discussed in previous labs, it is important to test your script on different kinds of input: input that is "regular" or "normal", and input that exercises the "edge cases" of the script. For example, for the <code>Add New Score</code> block, we recommend the following test cases: <br><ul><li>Adding a new score to an empty list.</li> 
  <li>Adding a new score that should be placed in the middle of a non-empty list.</li> 
  <li>Adding a new score that should become the highest score in a non-empty list.</li> 
  <li>Adding a new score that should become the lowest score in a non-empty list.</li> 
  <li>Adding a new score that is the same as another score in a non-empty list.</li> 
</ul> Your homework should include evidence of these tests; you may want to make a different list for each test case. To each test case, attach a comment that describes what is being tested. To make a comment, right-click anywhere on the <code>Scripts</code> section and select <code>add comment</code>. 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img border="0" title="Adding a Comment" alt="Adding a Comment" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/add-comment.png" ></div> BYOB will then provide a pale yellow box where you can add a comment. 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img border="0" title="New Comment" alt="New Comment" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/new-comment.png"  them to blocks: 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img border="0" title="Attaching a Comment" alt="Attaching a Comment" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/attaching-comment-BYOB.gif" ></div> Once a comment is attached to a block, the comment will follow the block wherever the block is dragged. 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img border="0" title="Attaching a Comment" alt="Attached a Comment" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/attached-comment-example-BYOB.gif" ></div><br>    </div>
    <div class="page-feedback">
      <button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs feedback-button" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#fdbk">Feedback</button>
      <div id="fdbk" class="collapse feedback-panel panel panel-primary"></div>
