As we have seen in the previous section, we generally use an index variable to process the elements of a list.  Below, we have reproduced the script that makes the character say the names of the players in a list.

<br><br><div style="margin-left:40px;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/read-player-list-code-BYOB.jpg" alt="Reading the names of the players in the list" title="Reading the names of the players in the list" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab05/Loops/ReadPlayerList.jpg"></div>

<br><br>

Modify the script to make the character say the following:

<ul><li>Every other name in a list.</li>
<li>Every third name in a list.</li>
<li>Names in a list in reverse order.</li>
<li>Names in a list that start with the letter <tt>C</tt>.</li>
<li>Names that are longer than four letters.</li>
</ul>

Remember to save your work!   </body></html>
