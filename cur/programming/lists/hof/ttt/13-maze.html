<p>Here's a solution to our <code>create object</code> block; you'll see that we abstracted the drawing routine as its own block.</p>

<p>Let's add our <code>create object</code> block to the end of our click detector script, so that whenever we click the board, it adds a Bug at that tile!</p>

<h3>Putting It All Together!</h3>
<p>Let's create a customizable, playable maze! Our final product will look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-maze-sneakpeek.png" alt="maze with player and obstacles on it" /></p>
<p>Head over to our Player sprite, and let's see how it works.</p>
<p>When the Green Flag is pressed, our player gets a position as a (row, column) coodinate. Notice that we have some arrow-key receivers set up- almost! When we press an arrow key, we want <code>position</code> to change accordingly. Take a look in <code>finish move</code> to see how we update the player's displayed position before we move on.</p>
<p>Let's fill in the arrow key receivers so that they change our position coordinate (which is a list of two values) appropriately. You can use the following blocks to get the "row" and "column" numbers out of the <code>position</code> variable, or you can just use "item 1" and "item 2"!</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-row-coords.png" alt="get row from coordinates" /></p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-col-coords.png" alt="get column from coordinates" /></p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Head to the <code>Player</code> sprite, and fill in the empty lists in the arrow key receivers with the appropriate code for changing the player's position.</p>
</div>
<p>The last thing we have to do is add a game over condition when we hit an obstacle. When does it make sense to check to see if the game should be over? <code>finish move</code> seems like a good place, because it gets run after every move.</p>
<p>Fill in the <code>finish move</code> block so that it checks to see if any objects are at our <code>position</code> on the Board. Some ideas for inside the condition: Turn the sprite red; speak the words "Game over!"; have our Player say "Oops, I hit a (object name)!"; Reset a timer when the flag is clicked and stop it when the game is over.</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Add a condition to <code>finish move</code> that checks the players <code>position</code> against the board, and do something if there's an object there!</p>
</div>
<h3>Avoiding "if touching"</h3>
<p>There's a big advantage to using boards to store info about our game state that we haven't discussed yet. And that is: using "if touching" under "sensing" is really slow.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's tempting to use several <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/touching.png" alt="touching block" /> to check if the <code>Player</code> sprite itself is touching another object or color on the stage. Sometimes it's useful to use one of these, but in general, they're <b>really slow!</b></p>
<p>Imagine if instead of moving in discrete steps and checking the item on the board at our position, we had a separate "forever if touching" script for each type of object we want to detect! This lead to repetitive code, AND each "forever if touching" really eats away at our speed.</p>
<p>Board representations can make games much more playable by allowing us to avoid all of this!</p>
