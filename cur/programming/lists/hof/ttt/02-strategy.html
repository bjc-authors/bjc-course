    <h3>
      Building the program
    </h3>
    <p>We're going to go through the program structure <em>bottom-up,</em> which means that you'll build helper blocks before you build <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-for-computer.png" alt="list of winning combinations" width="20%" height="20%"/> itself. But keep the goal in mind.</p>
    <div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
      <h4><strong>Thinking like a Computer Scientist</strong></h4>
      <p>A good way to approach building a program: Design top-down, implement bottom-up.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Remember on the last page, when we asked ourselves several questions about the game? Let's think about answering those, and how we could design the program to fit our goals.</p>
    <p><b>Question 1: What constitutes a good move?</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Before you continue, discuss with a neighbor what you think the most important rules for a good move are in tic-tac-toe.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The strategy your code for <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-for-computer.png" alt="list of winning combinations" width="20%" height="20%"/>  will need to implement three strategic rules: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Rule 1: If the computer can win; do so.</li>
    <li>Rule 2: If my opponent (the human player) can win; block them.</li>
    <li>Final rule: Otherwise, just pick the best empty square.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Board Design</h3>
    <p> 
      The board for this tic-tac-toe game is represented as a 9 item list with each item of the list representing a space in the board. X's and O's are placed where the players move and the blank spaces are represented by a number. The list is updated as each player takes their turn. For example, this list:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/example-board.png" alt="example board" width="20%" height="20%"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      corresponds to this tic-tac-toe board:
    </p> 
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/tic-tac-toe.png" align="middle" width="20%" height="20%"/>
      <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/tic-tac-toe-board-numbered.png" align="middle" width="20%" height="20%"/>   
      <br>(Notice: the empty spaces are represented by a number).
    </p> 
    <div class="assessment-data"  type="multiplechoice"  maxchoices="1" responseIdentifier="tic-tac-toe" hasinlinefeedback="true"  shuffle="false">
  <div class="prompt">
     <p>
       The <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-for-computer.png" alt="list of winning combinations" width="20%" height="20%"/> block will take in a list, like the one above, and "X" or an "O" signifying what the computer is playing as. Then it should report the number that corresponds to the space where the computer should move. Following the strategy above which what should this <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-example.png" alt="list of winning combinations" width="40%" height="40%"/> report when executed? 
     </p>
  </div>

  <div class="choice" identifier="c1">
     <div class="text">1</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         Space 1 is already filled with an "o".
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c2">
     <div class="text">O</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         This block should report a number representing a space in the board.
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c3">
     <div class="text">9</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         Correct!
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c4">
     <div class="text">4</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         The first rule the block should follow is " If I (the computer, player O) can win; do so." Can the computer playing as "O" win in the next round?
     </div>
  </div>

  <div class="responseDeclaration" identifier="tic-tac-toe">
    <div class="correctResponse" identifier="c3"></div>
  </div>
</div>

    <p>Thinking about the first two rules, we'll probably need to check if we ever have two in a row and the opponent isn't in the third spot. That is, if we see two X's and no O's in a row, then we know where to move to win! Think about what condition we'd need to look for to block opponent wins.</p>

      <b>Question 3: How do you win tic-tac-toe?</b> 
      <br>
      You win by getting "three in a row". A tic-tac-toe board is 3x3.
    </p>
    <div class="assessment-data"  type="multiplechoice"  maxchoices="1" responseIdentifier="tic-tac-toe-q3" hasinlinefeedback="true"  shuffle="false">
      <div class="prompt">
         <p>
           How many ways can you win tic-tac-toe? It's not 9 â€” think about it.

      <div class="choice" identifier="c2">

             Try drawing straight lines across a tic-tac-toe board where each line goes through three squares (this would be a winning move). How many lines can you draw? Try drawing it out on paper if you're stuck!
