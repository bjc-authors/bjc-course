In today's lab, we are going to get more practice working with lists by making a representation of a game board.  Make a new block as shown below that takes in a list and an <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> value.  It should make a new board with a <tt>B</tt> for every spot (representing a blank).

For example, the board below was made with <tt>x</tt> set to <tt>4</tt> (the number of columns) and <tt>y</tt> set to <tt>6</tt> (the number of rows).

<em>Note</em>: We chose to have the block modify the existing list <tt>game board</tt>, instead of reporting a <em>new</em> list, as shown in the example in the image below.  Think about how you could make a reporter block like the one below.  Remember that there is no <tt>set</tt> block for lists!
