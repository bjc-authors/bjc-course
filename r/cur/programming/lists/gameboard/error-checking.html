In the previous step we wrote a block to get a piece from our game board.

<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img hspace="0" height="22" width="232" vspace="0" border="0" title="There should be an image here" alt="There should be an image here" src="/r/img/list/get-game-piece-block-BYOB.gif" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/gameboard_representation/get_piece.gif"><br></div><br>But what should our block do if we tried to get the 9th row and 100th column in a 4x4 game board? We need to do some error checking to make sure that the arguments passed in are valid. <br><br>Add error checking code to the get block. If someone calls the block with a column or row outside of the range of the list, the block should report a blank. Make a comment in your "get" block to explain this behavior. <br><br>For the rest of this lab - make sure that you have error checking code in your blocks! <br><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br></div>   </body></html>
