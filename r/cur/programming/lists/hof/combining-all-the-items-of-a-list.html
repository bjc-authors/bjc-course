<p><br>Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers â€” that is, by the length of the list.<br>
<img width="428" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="84" border="0" src="../../../../img/list/hof/average.png" alt="average uses COMBINE WITH +" title="average uses COMBINE WITH +"/>
<br>Notice that the red <b>length of</b> block that finds the number of items in a list is different from the green <b>length of</b> block that finds the number of letters in a text string.

<br><br>The first input to the <b>combine with</b> block is a <i>two-input </i>function. In this case, it's the <b>+</b> block, because we want to add all the numbers. In fact, unlike the situation with the <b>map</b> and <b>keep</b> blocks, there are really only a handful of functions you'll ever use with <b>combine</b>:<br>
<img width="308" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="155" border="0" src="../../../../img/list/hof/bad-operators.png" alt="+, *, and, or, join, join words" title="+, *, and, or, join, join words"/>
</p>Why did we include the addition and multiplication operators, but not subtraction or division? Using an operator with <b>combine</b> makes sense only if it doesn't matter whether the values are combined left to right or right to left. That is,
<br>
3+(4+5) = (3+4)+5
<br>but
<br>3-(4-5) &ne; (3-4)-5

<p><br>Very occasionally you'll define a two-input custom reporter for use with <b>combine</b>.

</p><br><br><b>Try this: <br></b>
Write a two-input <b>max</b> function that takes two numbers as inputs and returns whichever is larger. Then use that with <b>combine</b> to find the largest number in a list.<br>We should try out the <b>average</b> block:<br>
<img width="319" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="87" border="0" src="../../../../img/list/hof/avg781.png" alt="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333" title="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333"/>
<br>Is that the answer you'd expect?<br><br>
