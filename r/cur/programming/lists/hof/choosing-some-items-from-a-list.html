<p><br>You've probably played Geography, the game in which one player says 
a place name and the next player has to name another place whose first 
letter is the last letter of the previous place: Newark, Kentucky, 
Yonkers, San Francisco, Oklahoma. Have you ever gotten stuck on the 
letter "A"? Oklahoma, Alabama, Asia, Alaska, America, Alameda... and so 
on, forever.</p>
How many states start and end with the same letter? To find out, we first need a list of all the states:<br>
<img title="Alabama, Alaska, ... Wisconsin, Wyoming" alt="Alabama, Alaska, ... Wisconsin, Wyoming" src="../../../../img/list/hof/states.png" height="124" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="463" border="0"/>

<p>Now we want to select a subset of the states, namely the ones whose 
first and last letters are the same. Here's the block we use for that:<br>
<img title="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" alt="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" src="../../../../img/list/hof/keepblock.png" height="20" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="193" border="0"/>

<p>Like <b>map</b>, the <b>keep</b> block has a function as its first input. 
Notice, though, that this grey ring's inner boundary is hexagonal. 
This lets you know that you should use a <i>predicate </i>function, 
which means a function that reports <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.

</p>We want to know whether two things are equal:<br>
<img title="&lt;&lt; &gt; = &lt; &gt;&gt;" alt="&lt;&lt; &gt; = &lt; &gt;&gt;" src="../../../../img/list/hof/equalblock.png" height="18" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="59" border="0"/>

<p>The first letter of a word is letter number 1:<br>
<img title="(LETTER (1) OF [])" alt="(LETTER (1) OF [])" src="../../../../img/list/hof/firstletterblock.png" height="18" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="89" border="0"><br>
(Note that we've deleted the word "world" that Snap! provides as a default 
value, a hint about what kind of input is expected. The input slot must 
be empty for our function-input notation to work.)

</p>Finding the last letter is a little trickier; you find the length of 
the text and use that number to select which letter you want:<br>
<img title="(LETTER (LENGTH OF []) OF [])" alt="(LETTER (LENGTH OF []) OF [])" src="../../../../img/list/hof/lastletterblock.png" height="22" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="136" border="0"/>

</p>Putting all these pieces together will give us the answer we want:<br>
<img title="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;...&gt;) FROM (STATES)" alt="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;...&gt;) FROM (STATES)" src="../../../../img/list/hof/geography.png" height="155" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="651" border="0"/>
<br>You can see from the "length: 4" in the result that there are four such states. The one you can't see in this picture is Ohio.

<p><br>But if you're playing Geography, the question you really want answered is 
"Which states start with such-and-such a letter?" You can define a block
 that takes a letter as input and gives the answer to that question:<br>
<img title="report (keep...) ..." alt="report (keep...) ..." src="../../../../img/list/hof/state-starting.png" height="84" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="402" border="0"></p>
<img title="states with P -&gt; pennsylvania" alt="states with P -&gt; pennsylvania" src="../../../../img/list/hof/p-states.png" height="134" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="297" border="0"><p>
<img title="states with S -&gt; south carolina, south dakota" alt="states with S -&gt; south carolina, south dakota" src="../../../../img/list/hof/s-states.png" height="134" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="297" border="0"/>

<p><br><br><b>Try this: <br></b>Write an expression that will select all the words of at least 
five letters from a list. For example, if the words in the list are <b>being</b>, 
<b>for</b>, <b>the</b>, <b>benefit</b>, <b>of</b>, <b>mister</b>, and <b>kite</b>, 
then your block should choose the words <b>being</b>, <b>benefit</b>, and <b>mister</b>.<br>
Write an expression that takes a list of mixed words and numbers, and selects just the numbers, 
(Hint: Look for <b>is</b> in the Operators palette.)<br>
Write an expression that selects from a list of words the ones that start with a vowel. 
(Hint: Use <b>contains</b> in the Variables palette.)<br><br>
