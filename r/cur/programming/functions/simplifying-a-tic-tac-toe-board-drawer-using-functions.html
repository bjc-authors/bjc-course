In the previous lab, we used a <tt>repeat</tt> block to avoid duplicating code.  Similarly, we can use a function to avoid duplicating code.
Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board.  Your goal is to create functions that make this code simpler.  One important thing to keep in mind is to give your new functions really intuitive names, so that it is easy to read the code and understand what it does.
