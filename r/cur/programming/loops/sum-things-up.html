			Now let's consider a slightly more complicated block that makes use of a loop.  
			It accepts two numbers as parameters (<tt>first</tt> and <tt>second</tt>) 
			and finds the sum of all of the numbers in the range <tt>[first, second]</tt>.
		</p>

		<img class="center" src="/r/img/blocks/sum-of-numbers-between-8-and-10.gif" />
		<p>
			When <tt>first = 8</tt> and <tt>second = 10</tt>, the output of this function will be <tt>27</tt> (8+9+10).  
			How do you think you'd make this block?  Try building it and see if you can make it work.
