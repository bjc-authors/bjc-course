			We're going to step away from the computer for some activities that your teacher will lead.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You'll use numbered cups to explore different ways to search for a number in a list of numbers.</li>
			<li>
				You'll think about ways to speed up this process.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Keep in mind the following questions while you are working on this activity:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				What strategies exist for finding a particular number in the fewest number of location checks?
			</li>
			<li>
				How many guesses would it take on average to find a number?
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didn&rsquo;t exist in the list at all?
			</li>
			<li>
				How much additional work will it be to find a number if N were to increase?
				<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
