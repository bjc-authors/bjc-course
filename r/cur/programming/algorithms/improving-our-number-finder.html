		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Feel free to ask your teacher for help on this section if you get stuck. We'll be discussing a somewhat difficult subject and it may be helpful to have it explained in person.</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		If the user may be searching for the same number multiple times, it seems ridiculous to calculate the answer each time that they ask. Why don&rsquo;t we remember the answer after it&rsquo;s been calculated instead? Remembering previously calculated information is called <span style="font-weight: bold;">memoization </span>(not memorization) in computer science. It is a powerful technique that can be used to speed up programs that have redundant calculations.
		<br>
		<br>
		Let&rsquo;s add a third block to our BYOB project (almost a copy of block #2, the sorted number finder) that uses memoization to remember the location of numbers that have already been found.
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" width="313" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="31" title="Memoized" alt="Memoized" src="/r/img/list/find-number-in-list-memoized.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/memoized.png">
			<br>
		</div>
		We&rsquo;ll use a list to keep track of the locations of numbers that we&rsquo;ve found already: the index of each element in the list will be the number we&rsquo;re looking for and the corresponding value will be the location where that number was found. If the value at a particular index is -1, that means that we haven&rsquo;t looked for the number yet and if the value is 0 then that means that the number doesn't exist in the list. Here is an algorithm describing how the new BYOB block should progress using the new memoization list:
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Start off setting all of the slots in <span style="font-style: italic;">memory </span>to -1 because we haven't found any numbers yet.
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Check the global list <span style="font-style: italic;">memory</span> to determine if the number in question has already been found.
			</li>
			<li>
				If so, report the saved location. If not, we&rsquo;ll have to calculate it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Find the number&rsquo;s location using the sorted technique we&rsquo;ve used in the past.
			</li>
			<li>
				Save the location of the number in the <span style="font-style: italic;">memory </span>list so that we don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t have to go through this pain again.
			</li>
		</ol>
		Each value will now be computed a maximum of one time. Now that&rsquo;s fast!
