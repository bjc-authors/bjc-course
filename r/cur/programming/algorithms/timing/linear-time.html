<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have noticed that if you increased <tt>max</tt> by a factor of two, then the computer took approximately twice as much time to fill the <tt>numbers</tt> list. &Acirc;&nbsp;Similarly, if you increased <tt>max</tt> by a factor of ten, then the computer took approximately ten times as much time; if you increased <tt>max</tt> by a factor of 100, then the computer ran approximately 100 times longer. &Acirc;&nbsp;In general, as we scale the size of the input by a certain amount, we also scale the running time by the same amount. &Acirc;&nbsp;We call these algorithms <strong>linear-time</strong>&Acirc;&nbsp;algorithms, because if we were to plot the runtime of one such algorithm against the size of its input, we would get a line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the algorithm a linear-time algorithm? &Acirc;&nbsp;When <tt>max</tt> was set to <tt>20</tt>, we had to add 20 numbers to the <tt>numbers</tt>list; when <tt>max</tt> was set to <tt>40</tt>, we had to add 40 numbers to the number list. &Acirc;&nbsp;In other words, as we scaled <tt>max</tt>, we also scaled how many numbers we had to add to the <tt>numbers</tt> list by the same amount. &Acirc;&nbsp;Linear-time algorithms are also much sought-after in computer science, and for many problems, they are the fastest algorithms you can find.</p>   </body></html>
