  <div style="text-align: left;">Now that you have some experience with some recursion, we're going to point out some of the anatomy of a recursive procedure.<br><ul><li>We always need a way to figure out that we're done and shouldn't call the recursive call again. Lines 2-4 are the "Base Case" where we handle things that are SO simple we don't need to call the recursive case again.</li>
      <li>If this isn't the base case we think to ourselves "Woah - That seems complicated. I'll just do a small part of the problem and delegate to someone else". Here's what we do:<br></li>
      <ul><li>draw the trunk of the tree (line 6), <br></li>
        <li>position the character for the left sub-tree (line 7), <br></li>
        <li>delegate to another copy of the tree block to draw the left sub-tree (line 8), </li>
        <li>re-position the character for the right sub-tree (line 9),</li>
        <li>delegate to another copy of the tree block to draw the right sub-tree (line 10),</li>
        <li>re-position the character to retrace the trunk (line 11), and<br></li>
        <li>re-trace the trunk and leave the character exactly where it started out.</li>
      </ul></ul>This wasn't the "best" one we discussed in a previous step, but is a good example of a base case. (Note here we addressed the problem of getting infinite recursion when we have a level less than 0.<br><br></div><img hspace="0" height="583" border="0" width="574" vspace="0" src="/r/img/recur/tree-with-base-case-BYOB.jpg" alt="There should be an image here" title="There should be an image here" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab11/Recurisve_Tree/TreeWithbaseCase.jpg"></div>   </body></html>
