			4. That TREE2 block is pretty long and repetitive. But we can simplify it if we notice that in two places it has a move forward/move back pair of blocks, and that this is what TREE1 does! So we can use TREE1 to shorten TREE2. Compare the code below to convince yourself that the new Tree2a will work the same as the original Tree2.

			Note that the tree blocks inside this TREE2A script are TREE1 blocks, not TREE2 blocks! So there's no mysterious TREE-using-TREE situation here; it's not unusual for one block to be used in another block's script.
		</p>
		<p>
			5. Make a TREE3 block that uses the TREE2 block, on the same pattern, and see if you get the result that you expect.
		</p>
		<p>
			6. If you can stand it, make a TREE4 block that uses the TREE3 block and try it out.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>This would be a good time to save your project.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			7. Okay, here's the big idea: We can write a TREE block that uses itself in its own script <i>provided that it knows how many levels it's expected to draw!</i> So, in addition to the size input, it'll have a LEVELS input:
		</p>
		<p>
			In the earlier steps, TREE3 used TREE2; TREE2 used TREE1. Here, TREE will use TREE, but reducing the number of levels by 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			8. Once you can draw a tree of five or six levels using your TREE block, see if you can make one like the first picture in this handout. It's different from what we've done so far because the smaller trees are drawn part way up the trunk, instead of at the top of the trunk, and because the pen color is green for the lowest-level branches (the TREE1-like ones) and brown for the others. You don't have to get it exactly like the picture; just try to make a more realistic-looking tree.
